//Ways of simplifying a problem

Split into smaller sub-problems ==> Splits array into chunks
                                ==> Possibly combined with...
                                ==> Recursion

--> Console.log(),
--> Breakpoint()

// Helper variables (eg helper arrays to store intermidaite resullts )


//Practice Makes Perfect//
