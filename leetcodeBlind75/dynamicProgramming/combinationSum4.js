/**
 * 
 
Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
All the elements of nums are unique.
1 <= target <= 1000
 

Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

function combinationSum4(nums, target) {
    const dp = new Array(target + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1; // There's one way to make the target 0 (using no numbers)

    for (let t = 1; t <= target; t++) {
        for (const num of nums) {
            if (t - num >= 0) { // check if the number can contribute to the target 
                dp[t] += dp[t - num];  // add the previous combinations count if we use this number to the current target combinations count.
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[target];
}




console.log(combinationSum4([1, 2, 3], 4)); // Expected output: 7
